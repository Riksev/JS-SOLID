Hello! Let me quickly introduce you into the project. First of all, purpose of this repository is to implement and get used to SOLID principles. 
They are:
- Single responsibility principle
- Open-closed principle
- Liskov's substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

# Content
We have a few files here.<br />
For testing:<br />
- shopAdministration_old.test.js
- shopAdministration_new.test.js
For NPM:<br />
- package.json
For demonstration:<br />
- shopAdministration_old.js
- shopAdministration_new.js

# Navigation
How to navigate through tests and demonstration?<br />
Files with '_ old' mean that they were at the beginning of the project before implementing SOLID.<br />
Files with '_ new' mean final solutions.<br />
Example of code without SOLID was generated by ChatGPT and has been edited a little bit for easier testing.<br />
Final solution was implemented by me.<br />
