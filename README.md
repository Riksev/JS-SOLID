# JS-SOLID
Hello! Let me quickly introduce you into the project. First of all, purpose of this repository is to implement and get used to SOLID principles. 
They are:
- Single responsibility principle
- Open-closed principle
- Liskov's substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

# Content
We have a few files here.
For testing:
- shopAdministration_old.test.js
- shopAdministration_new.test.js
For NPM:
- package.json
For demonstration:
- shopAdministration_old.js
- shopAdministration_new.js

# Navigation
How to navigate through tests and demonstration?
Files with '_ old' mean that they were at the beginning of the project before implementing SOLID.
Files with '_ new' mean final solutions.
Example of code without SOLID was generated by ChatGPT, so IDK from where exactly this code was taken.
Final solution was implemented by me.
