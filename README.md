They are:

- Open-closed principle
- Liskov's substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle

- shopAdministration_new.test.js<br />
<br />
For NPM:<br />
- package.json<br />
<br />
For demonstration:<br />

# Navigation
How to navigate through tests and demonstration?<br />
Files with '_ old' mean that they were at the beginning of the project before implementing SOLID.<br />
Files with '_ new' mean final solutions.<br />
Example of code without SOLID was generated by ChatGPT and has been edited a little bit for easier testing.<br />
Final solution was implemented by me.<br />
